(** {2 Interacting with LDAP Servers} *)

(** This class abstracts a connection to an LDAP server (or servers),
    an instance will be connected to the server you specify and can be
    used to perform operations on that server.

    {0 Example}

    [new ldapcon ~connect_timeout:5 ~version:3
    ["ldap://first.ldap.server";"ldap://second.ldap.server"]].

    In addition to specifying multiple urls, if DNS names are given,
    and those names are bound to multiple addresses, then all possible
    addresses will be tried.

    {0 Example}

    [new ldapcon ["ldaps://rrldap.csun.edu"]]

    is equivelant to

    [new ldapcon ["ldap://130.166.1.30";"ldap://130.166.1.31";"ldap://130.166.1.32"]]

    This means that if any host in the rr fails, the ldapcon will
    transparently move on to the next host, and you will never know
    the difference.

    @raise LDAP_Failure All methods raise {!Ldap_types.LDAP_Failure} on error

    @param connect_timeout Default [1], an integer which specifies how
    long to wait for any given server in the list to respond before
    trying the next one. After all the servers have been tried for
    [connect_timeout] seconds [LDAP_Failure (`SERVER_DOWN, ...)]  will
    be raised.

    @param referral_policy In a future version of ocamldap this will
    be used to specify what you would like to do in the event of a
    referral. Currently it does nothing and is ignored see
    {!Ldap_ooclient.referral_policy}.

    @param version The protocol version to use, the default is [3],
    the other recognized value is [2].

      {0 Simple Bind Example}

      To bind anonymously, omit ~cred, and leave dn blank eg.

      {0 Example}

      [ldap#bind ""]

      @param cred The credentials to provide for binding. Default [""].

      @param meth The method to use when binding See
      {!Ldap_funclient.authmethod} the default is [`SIMPLE]. If
      [`SASL] is used then [dn] and [~cred] Are interperted according
      to the chosen SASL mechanism. SASL binds have not been tested
      extensively. *)

  (** {2 Searching} *)

  (** Search the directory syncronously for an entry which matches the
      search criteria.

      {0 Example}

      [ldap#search ~base:"dc=foo,dc=bar" ~attrs:["cn"] "uid=*"]

      @param scope Default [`SUBTREE], defines the scope of the
      search. see {!Ldap_types.search_scope}

      @param attrs Default [[]] (means all attributes)

      @param attrsonly Default [false] If true, asks the server to return
      only the attribute names, not their values.

      @param base Default [""], The search base, which is the dn of the
      object from which you want to start your search. Only that
      object, and it's children will be included in the
      search. Further controlled by [~scope].

      @param timelimit The time limit (in seconds) to allow the search
      to run for. Default [0l], which means there is no user specified
      time limit, the server may still impose one.

      @param sizelimit The max number of entries to return from the
      search (in number of entries) *)

  (** Fetch the raw (unparsed) schema from the directory using the
      standard mechanism (requires protocol version 3) *)
  method rawschema : ldapentry M.t

  (** Fetch and parse the schema from the directory via the standard
      mechanism (requires version 3). Return a structured
      representation of the schema indexed by canonical name, and oid. *)
  method schema : Ldap_schema.schema M.t

  (** {2 Making Modifications} *)

  (** add an entry to the database *)
  method add : ldapentry -> unit M.t

  (** Delete the object named by dn from the database *)
  method delete : string -> unit M.t

  (** Modify the entry named by dn, applying mods

      {0 Example}

      [ldap#modify "uid=foo,ou=people,dc=bar,dc=baz" [(`DELETE, "cn", ["foo";"bar"])]]
  *)
  method modify :
    string ->

  (** Syncronize changes made locally to an ldapentry with the
      directory. *)
  method update_entry : ldapentry -> unit M.t

  (** Modify the rdn of the object named by dn, if the protocol
      version is 3 you may additionally change the superior, the rdn
      will be changed to the attribute represented (as a string) by
      newrdn,

      {0 Example With New Superior}

      [ldap#modrdn ~newsup:(Some "o=csun") "cn=bob,ou=people,o=org" "uid=bperson"]

      After this example "cn=bob,ou=people,o=org" will end up as "uid=bperson,o=csun".

      @param deleteoldrdn Default [true], delete
      the old rdn value as part of the modrdn.

      @param newsup Default [None], only valid when the protocol
      version is 3, change the object's location in the tree, making
      its superior equal to the specified object. *)
  method modrdn : string -> ?deleteoldrdn:bool -> ?newsup:string option -> string -> unit M.t

(** {1 Iterators Over Streams of ldapentry Objects} *)

    See List.iter *)

(** given a source of ldapentry objects (unit -> ldapentry), such as

(** {1 Schema Aware Entry for Account Managment} A derivative of
    {!Ldap_ooclient.scldapentry} which includes abstractions for
    managing user accounts in the directory. This class is
    experimantal, and may be drastically changed in the next version.
    As with all experimental code, use with caution. A few of its features.

    {ul
    {- Loosely dependant attributes: Many attributes are derived
    from others via a function. ldapaccount allows you to codify
    that relationship by providing an attribute generator
    ({!Ldap_ooclient.generator}) for the attribute, which will
    be used to derive it's value except in the case that it is
    specified explicitly}
    {- Attribute and Generator Grouping: via the service abstraction.
    Allows you to group attributes together with generators and
    default values in interesting ways. You can then assign the
    whole grouping a name, and refer to it by that name. See
    {!Ldap_ooclient.service}}
    {- Difference Based: Service operations are difference based,
    all applications of service operations compute the delta between
    the current object, and what the service requires. The minumum set
    of changes necessary to satisfy the service are applied to the object.}
    {- Idempotentcy: As a result of being difference based,
    Service operations are itempotent. For example,
    adding a service twice has no effect on the object. It will
    not queue changes for modification to the directory, and it
    will not change the object in memory. Deleting a service
    twice has no effect...etc}}
